# Capstone-Project---PGP-DSBA

## Project Summary:

### This project focuses on predicting account-level churn and segmenting customers for targeted retention. Key churn drivers include short tenure, recent support contact, and high cashback use. Three customer segments were identified: high-value, moderate-engagement, and at-risk. Actionable strategies include strengthening onboarding, refining cashback programs, and detecting sudden spenders with churn risk. The recommendations aim to reduce churn, improve engagement, and enhance customer lifetime valueâ€”while ensuring campaigns remain cost-effective and aligned with revenue assurance goals.
